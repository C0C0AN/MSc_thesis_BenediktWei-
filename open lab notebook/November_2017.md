1st week: 
- I started working through the scientific python tutorial
- Preview for 2nd week: Tutorials for nibabel and numpy
- Find tutorials on (https://github.com/nipy/workshops)

2nd week:
- worked through numpy-tutorial:
  - more information about array interfaces on (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.interface.html)
  - array broadcasting rules extension: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.broadcasting.html 
  - basics about matrix-operations: https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathematik_f%C3%BCr_Wirtschaftswissenschaftler:_Rechenregeln_f%C3%BCr_Matrizen
 
3rd week:
- I completed the first nibabel-tutorial and performed [literature research](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0995-06.2006), [2](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811916307121), [3](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003412)
- here you can find some extra knowledge about [assertations](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingAssertionsEffectively) in python
- I repeated [mri-axis orientations](http://www.grahamwideman.com/gw/brain/orientation/orientterms.htm) in context of the done nibabel-tutorial

4th week:
- for completion of nibabel-tutorials (plotting of surfaces) I used an other [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/satra/ibro-workshop-2017/) 
- I started with the nipype-tutorials and finished the first one (quickstart). For this I had to download the corresponding [updated image](https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial)
- some problems about the understanding of correct directoring and the relation between keys, ports, images and notebooks occured, therefore I wrote a short text as a reminder of steps I performed between different docker images (see uploaded directories.odt)
- last, here are some additional informations, which are useful for the done tutorials: [iterfields](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/mapnode_and_iterables.html), [pipelines and interfaces](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.pipeline.engine.nodes.html)
