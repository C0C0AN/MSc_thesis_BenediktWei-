- I started writing my ethic proposal

01/15 - 01/21/2018:

- I finished the 1st version of my ethic proposal on wednesday and shared it on slack for discussion/correction by the group
- the rest of the week I corrected grammatical and formal issues being highlighted by colleagues
- still some aspects remain for discussion: for more details see [documentation of ethic proposal](https://github.com/weissbe92/MSc_thesis_BenediktWeiss/tree/master/ethic%20proposal)
- still remaining: appendix of ethic proposal 

01/22 - 01/28/2018:

- After writing the ethic proposal, I started working through Nipype-tutorials again (function nodes, mapnodes, join nodes, model specification) and red some [literature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307121)
