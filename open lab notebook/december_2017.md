- I wrote an [exposee](https://github.com/weissbe92/MSc_thesis_BenediktWeiss/blob/master/open%20lab%20notebook/exposee.md) according to the experiment I want to perform
- in context of the exposee I did more literature research
- for weekly not-a-meeting-meeting I prepared a presentation about fourier transform together with Klara
