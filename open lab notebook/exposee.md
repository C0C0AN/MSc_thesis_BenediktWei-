The aim of this study is to examine connectivity differences between areas of the auditory core network regarding to the processing of speech, singing and non vocal musical stimuli. Furthermore, the influence of handedness (left- vs. righthanded) and musical training (musicians vs. non-musicians) on neuronal processing within the auditory network will be investigated.
The auditory core network consists of three main areas: the primary auditory cortex (PAC or HG for Heschel's gyrus) (Da Costa et al., 2011) and, as non primary allocations within the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the planum polare (anterior STG) and planum temporale, pinpointed at the posterior part of STG (Zatorre, 2002). Based on the vast amount of investigations during the past decade, it seems that the cortical processing of music, singing and speech is in parts distinct from each other (Norman-Haignere, Kanwisher, & McDermott, 2015; Rogalsky, Rong, Saberi, & Hickok, 2011)⁠. Also hemispheric lateralisation effects have been reported, assuming that the processing of language seems to be more left lateralized while music processing tends to be shifted towards the right hemisphere (Josse & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2004; Tervaniemi, 2006)⁠. Notably, possible lateralisation effects in the auditory cortex are still very contradictory. As one factor proposed to influence the processing of speech and music, Angulo-Perkins et al. (2014)⁠ showed that bilateral activation of the mainly music-senstitive region planum polare occured more often in musicians than in non-musicians and that the typically observed separated and lateralized processing of these two modalities seems to vanish.
For this study, we want to recrute 4 cohorts of paricipants differing from each other in the aspects of handedness and musical training. One part of the study will compare right-handed musicians and right-handed non-musicians, the other part will aim for differences between left-handed non-musicians compared to right-handed non-musicians. 
To this end, participants will listen to three auditory stimuli-types (speech, singing, non vocal music) while undergoing an fMRI-session.
