- programmed the experiment in Psychopy (version 1.85.3):
  - wrote a randomisation-file pseuorandomising 5 stimuli of same modality into blocks
  - we now have 12 stimulus-blocks of each modality, in summary 36 blocks, which should be presented in a counterbalanced order
  - waiting for an answer of neuropowertools, which should generate 3 optimally balanced block-sequencies for 3 runs
  
  - still have to work on the csv-outputfile, automise generation of new csv-files for each participant (create folder, tell psychopy where to find csv-file)
  - still missing: integrate code into psychopy-builder and set a trigger (keypress-routine to simulate scanner-trigger and logfile-generation)
