- programmed the experiment in Psychopy (version 1.85.3):
  - wrote a randomisation-file pseuorandomising 5 stimuli of same modality into blocks
  - we now have 12 stimulus-blocks of each modality, in summary 36 blocks, which should be presented in a counterbalanced order
  - waiting for an answer of neuropowertools, which should generate 3 optimally balanced block-sequencies for 3 runs
  
  - still have to work on the csv-outputfile, automise generation of new csv-files for each participant (create folder, tell psychopy where to find csv-file)
  - still missing: integrate code into psychopy-builder and set a trigger (keypress-routine to simulate scanner-trigger and logfile-generation) 
  
- update: psychopy script had to be changed to fit in the windows system of the used presentation pc at the scanner
- implemented in script: block-presentation, randomized interblock delays, randomised usage of runfiles for runs, eeg-trigger before each block, mri-trigger before each run
- still to do: 
  - implement the movieloop from mirjam instead of just showing a fixation cross on the screen
  - jitter interstimulus-intervals (2.5 secs to split up into 5 delays) and look at the durations of the stimuli (all same length or different? --> problem, if 5 randomly picked stimuli would together last longer than 7.5 secs)
  - include a 4th run
  - still no answer from neuropowertools on optimal counterbalanced block-sequences for our experiment --> alternative?!
